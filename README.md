RCC Classification

This project implements a decision tree classifier from scratch in Python with a focus on interpretability and pathology-informed domain knowledge. The primary goal is to support renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype classification by explicitly modeling how morphological features and immunohistochemistry (IHC) features reduce diagnostic uncertainty.

Unlike off-the-shelf libraries (ex. scikit-learn), this implementation exposes  mathematical and algorithmic step—making ideal for explainability, debugging, and domain-driven customization.
